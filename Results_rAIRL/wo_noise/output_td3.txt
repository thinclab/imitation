Running with `allow_variable_horizon` set to True. Some algorithms are biased towards shorter or longer episodes, which may significantly confound results. Additionally, even unbiased algorithms can exploit the information leak from the termination condition, producing spuriously high performance. See https://imitation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guide/variable_horizon.html for more information.
